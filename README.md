# Blynk-App-Nodemcu-and-other-sensors

GPS TRACKER:
It consist of nodemcu, blynk app and neo 6m gps module code, through which you can trace your exact location via simple coding.
code is attached herewith. Do look for video for demonstration.

GPS systems are extremely versatile and can be found in almost any industry sector. They can be used to map forests, help farmers harvest their fields, and navigate rovers on the ground.

Global positioning system applications generally fall into 5 major categories:
 Location - determining a position
 Navigation - getting from one location to another
 Tracking - monitoring object or personal movement
 Mapping - creating maps of the world
 Timing - bringing precise timing to the world
The NEO-6M GPS module is a well-performing complete GPS receiver with a built-in 25 x 25 x 4mm ceramic antenna, which provides a strong satellite search capability. With the power and signal indicators, you can monitor the status of the module. Thanks to the data backup battery, the module can save the data when the main power is shut down accidentally. Its 3mm mounting holes can ensure easy assembly.

I have made a app using customised blynk app, which has several fields like latitude, longitude, speed , drection, satelite, maps through which it is easy for user to trace.

Obstacle avoidance-

It again consist of blynk app, sonar sensor and nodemcu which help in tracing the object in proximity of device.
several condition is also given according to which it tells the user about status, inbuilt map is also used to trace the location.

Several fields like red blynk(in app) -> distance< 10
                    yellow(in app) ->  10<distance<=30
                    green(in app)->   30<distance<=50
                    
        if distance is less than 10, it will again show a pop up message that object is very near to it.
